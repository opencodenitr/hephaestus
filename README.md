## Projects

This repository will contain small automation/crazy/fun projects made using Python Programming Language. At present, the projects contained in this repository are:
  1. [Star Wars Lite](https://github.com/opencodenitr/hephaestus/tree/main/Star%20Wars%20Lite)
  2. [Grumpy](https://github.com/007vedant/hephaestus/tree/main/Grumpy)



## Running Projects

1. Although every project can be run in a global environment after installing the required dependencies, we strongly recommend using a virtual environment for each project to avoid clashes and compatibility issues and to ease the contribution. A virtual environment can be setup using [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APOPm01BVrk).

2. Inside the virtual environment, install the dependencies and libraries for each project using the requirements.txt file available in the project directories. To install the dependencies use the following in the terminal

    `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. The project can be run directly via any text editor using main.py file present in the project directories. To run the project via terminal, use the following command.

    `python main.py`
